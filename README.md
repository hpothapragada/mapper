# Mapper for Graphs
 
Using A  Distributed Mapper to do Topological Data Analysis on Graphs 

How can we TDA to turn high dimensional data about graph nodes (telco and/or bank users) into a 2-D representation for better insights? 

Here are some useful links about TDA

For problems such as churn and segmentation, TDA could be a useful tool that distinguishes itself from clustering.

However, a scalable, distributed version of the Mapper Algorithm is not well known, and probably not fully formed as of March 17th, 2017.
